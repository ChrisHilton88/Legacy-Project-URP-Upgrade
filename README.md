This project was designed to showcase how to update an existing projects code (that used the Old Input System) to use the New Input System in Unity.​
​
Some of the features updated include:
- Breaking the Player, Drone and Forklift Actions into their own respective Action Maps and Actions, making use of the same keyboard   
  controls W, A, S, D, R, F and Q but providing different functionality depending on which Action Map is active.​​
- Interactable events now use a single interact button 'E' with interactions - 'Tap' and 'Hold'.
- Destructible crate event now destroys one or many pieces depending on whether the 'Tap' or 'Hold' interaction was triggered.
- Project now supports Keyboard and Xbox Controller.
